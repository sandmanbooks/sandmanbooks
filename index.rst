<p><img alt="Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton" src="/sites/sandmanbooks.com/files/pictures/blog-if-like-bridgerton.jpg" style="float: right; width: 300px;" /></p>

<p>Suddenly, everyone is interested in Regency romance again! It’s no mystery that Bridgerton captured our imaginations with its lush sets, opulent costumes, and lavish soundtrack. The film adaptation of Julia Quinn’s romance series (which, by the way, has 13 books) hit just the right note – and we’re hungry for more. &nbsp;</p>

<p>But: it’s actually kind of hard to find “books like Bridgerton.” Sure, there are a gazillion regency romance novels (if you want to explore the genre, start with <a href="/book/9781492677635">Georgette Heyer</a>), but the real &nbsp;joy here is the immersive nature of the experience. The audience is carried away by the flowers, the music, the silks, the intrigue – and the fireworks! (Both literally and figuratively.)</p>

<p>It’s more than just a romance in the “weddings at the end” sense. It’s a romance in the old-fashioned, swashbuckling sense. This is romance in the way that Errol Flynn movies are romantic – in the way that Jules Verne stories are romantic. It’s a tale of adventure in the great wide somewhere…</p>

<p>With that in mind, here are some book recommendations that I think reflect the spirit of the Bridgerton series (complete with happy endings).</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="/book/9780156035217">The Princess Bride</a>&nbsp;by William Goldman. The beloved childhood favorite was actually based on a 1973 novel (the author wrote the screenplay as well). True love! Swordfights! Magic! Pirates! Adventure!</li>
	<li><img alt="Country Diary of An Edwardian Lady" src="https://images.booksense.com/images/903/858/9780847858903.jpg" style="float: right; width: 120px;" />&nbsp;<a href="/book/9780847858903">Country Diary of An Edwardian Lady</a> by Edith Holden. If your favorite part of Bridgerton is TheAesthetic™, you will love this 1906 chronicle of a year in the English countryside. Full of watercolors by the author, it’s a treasure for natural historians and artists alike.</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9780765325600">Shades of Milk and Honey</a>&nbsp;by Mary Kowal. This sweet, cottagecore romance has magic interwoven into a plot tapestry as visually delicate as its Regency setting. Utterly charming, it gives the reader a sense of walking through fields in spring.</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9781586638481">Midsummer Night's Dream</a>&nbsp;by William Shakespeare. Yeah, it’s a play. Yeah, it’s set in the wrong century. But this classic comedy is full of the same things that make Bridgerton such a treat: lighthearted magic, colorful characters, and silly misunderstandings that all work out in the end. Elizabethan slang can be a little bit of a challenge for the modern reader, so I like the “parallel text” edition which allows you to understand the story using familiar language, while still retaining the poetry of the original words.</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9780486284736">Pride &amp; Prejudice</a>&nbsp;by Jane Austen. The story that started it all! Austen’s famous novel has been adapted over and over and over again for the screen, and it’s easy to see why. Complex characters, realistic sibling interactions, and an unforgettable dry wit keep readers coming back for more even after all these centuries. Fair warning: this book is HUGE.</li>
	<li><img alt="Jane Austen Charles Dickens" src="https://images.booksense.com/images/365/882/9780671882365.jpg" style="float: right; width: 120px;" /><a href="/book/9780671882365">What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew</a>&nbsp;by Daniel Pool. This volume is full of juicy details about the time period – which can be really helpful if you do decide to tackle Pride &amp; Prejudice. It’s also a good read on its own!&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9780553385618">Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor</a>&nbsp;by Stephanie Barron. This adorable series explores the question: what if Jane Austen were a detective?</li>
</ol>

<p>Honorable mentions:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Sorcery and Cecelia</em> by Caroline Stevermer and Patricia Wrede. An epistolary novel, this cute fantasy revolves around the friendship between two young ladies in Regency England – and their encounters with magicians&nbsp;in the same social circles. Unfortunately, it can be hard to find, but I love it so much I couldn't bear to leave it off the&nbsp;list.</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9781452140070">Meaningful Bouquets</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;beautiful photos of floral arrangements... you know, the kind required by every member of the ton.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><img alt="Bridgerton" src="https://images.booksense.com/images/622/435/9780770435622.jpg" style="float: right; width: 120px;" /><a href="/book/9781618372345">Tablescapes</a>&nbsp;is a great place to start if you're inspired to host your own lavish dinner parties!</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9781423644590">Berries</a> makes me want to have a picnic, like, immediately.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9780770435622">Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey: The Lost Legacy of Highclere Castle</a> by The Countess of Carnarvon. The extraordinary true story of life before, during and after the First World War - in&nbsp;Highclere Castle (the location where Downton Abbey was filmed).&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9781013595059">Country Housewife</a>&nbsp;is a primary source if you're interested in more serious history books.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9781492622079">Poldark</a>&nbsp;is another book series turned small screen historical drama - with equally swoonworthy leading characters.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="/book/9780440241485">Lord John and the Private Matter</a>&nbsp;is an Outlander spinoff focusing on Lord John, a Regency gentleman who often finds himself solving mysteries.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven't read Julia Quinn's&nbsp;novels yet, start with&nbsp;<a href="/book/9780063078697">The Duke &amp; I</a>&nbsp;(first in the Bridgerton series), which was adapted for Season One of the show.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
